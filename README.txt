Command-line compression/decompression tool for .raf / .raf.dat archive pairs as used by the League of Legends beta patcher. Modders and skinners will have to adapt to this new file structure when the old patcher is replaced with the current beta patcher.

All credits for reverse engineering the .raf / .raf.dat data structures go to GorbyRU (US server). See http://www.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=649185&page=8.

Due to being in the early stages of development, this tool currently only supports decompression and has been written in a VERY "quick and dirty" manner.
